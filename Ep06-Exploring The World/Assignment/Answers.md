## Q1: What is `Microservice` ?

A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that each serve a specific business function. These services communicate with each other over a network, typically using HTTP APIs or messaging queues.

### Key Characteristics of Microservices:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and does one thing well. This makes the service easier to understand, develop, and maintain.

2. **Independence**: Microservices are independently deployable and scalable. This means that updates, scaling, or changes to one service do not necessarily affect others.

3. **Decentralized Data Management**: Each microservice typically manages its own database, which allows for greater flexibility and prevents tight coupling between services.

4. **Communication**: Microservices communicate with each other through APIs, often using REST, gRPC, or messaging systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

5. **Resilience**: If one microservice fails, it doesn't bring down the entire system. Other services can continue operating, and the system can handle failures gracefully.

6. **Technology Diversity**: Different microservices can be built using different programming languages, frameworks, or databases, depending on what best suits the specific service's needs.

### Advantages:

- **Scalability**: You can scale individual services as needed without affecting the entire application.
- **Flexibility**: Easier to adopt new technologies within a single service.
- **Faster Development**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously, leading to faster development cycles.
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues within one service are less likely to impact the entire application.

### Challenges:

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple services introduces complexity in terms of deployment, monitoring, and communication.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across services can be challenging.
- **Network Latency**: Since services communicate over a network, latency and reliability can be concerns.

Microservices are popular in cloud-native environments and are a key component of modern, scalable, and flexible application architectures.

## Q2: What is `Monolith architecture` ?

Monolith architecture is a traditional software design approach where an application is built as a single, unified unit. In this architecture, all the components of the application, including the user interface (UI), business logic, and data access layers, are tightly coupled and run as a single process.

### Key Characteristics of Monolith Architecture:

1. **Unified Codebase**: The entire application is developed, deployed, and scaled as a single unit, meaning all components are interconnected and interdependent.

2. **Single Deployment**: The application is packaged into a single executable or a single set of files and is deployed on a server as one entity. If any part of the application is updated, the entire application must be redeployed.

3. **Shared Database**: Typically, a monolithic application uses a single database for all components, which can lead to tight coupling between different parts of the application.

4. **Single Programming Language**: The entire application is usually written in one programming language and framework, making it simpler to develop and maintain.

5. **Tightly Coupled Components**: All components of the application are tightly integrated, which can make it harder to modify or scale individual parts of the application without affecting others.

### Advantages:

- **Simplicity**: Easier to develop and test because of its unified structure. All components are in one place, so you don’t have to deal with complex distributed systems.
- **Performance**: Since all components are in the same process, there's no network overhead for communication between different parts of the application.
- **Easier Deployment**: Deploying a monolithic application is straightforward since everything is packaged together.

### Challenges:

- **Lack of Flexibility**: As the application grows, it becomes difficult to introduce new technologies or frameworks because the entire application is tied to a single technology stack.
- **Scalability Issues**: Scaling a monolith often means scaling the entire application, even if only one part of it requires more resources.
- **Slower Development**: As the codebase grows, it becomes harder to manage, leading to slower development and longer release cycles.
- **Difficult Maintenance**: Changes in one part of the application can have unintended consequences elsewhere, making it harder to maintain and evolve over time.

### When to Use Monolith Architecture:

- **Simple or Small Applications**: Monoliths are suitable for simple, small applications where the complexity of microservices would be unnecessary.
- **Early Stage Development**: If you're building a product from scratch and want to get it to market quickly, starting with a monolith can be easier.
- **Resource Constraints**: When a team is small or lacks the expertise to manage the complexities of a microservices architecture, a monolith can be a practical choice.

Monolith architecture is often seen as a good starting point, especially for new applications or small teams. However, as the application grows in complexity, it may become necessary to refactor the monolith into microservices to achieve better scalability and flexibility.

## Q3: What is the difference between `Monolith` and `Microservice` ?

The primary difference between monolith and microservice architectures lies in how the application is structured, deployed, and managed. Here's a detailed comparison:

### 1. **Structure:**

- **Monolith Architecture:**

  - The entire application is built as a single, cohesive unit. All components—such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layers—are tightly integrated and run together.
  - Typically, the application has a single codebase, which makes the components interdependent.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
  - The application is divided into multiple small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability. These services are loosely coupled and operate independently.
  - Each microservice has its own codebase, allowing teams to work on different services simultaneously.

### 2. **Deployment:**

- **Monolith Architecture:**

  - Deployed as a single unit. Any update, no matter how small, requires redeploying the entire application.
  - Easier to deploy in a single environment but harder to scale specific parts of the application.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
  - Each service can be deployed independently. Changes in one service do not require redeploying the entire application.
  - Allows for more frequent and independent deployments, making it easier to update and scale individual services.

### 3. **Scalability:**

- **Monolith Architecture:**

  - Scaling typically involves scaling the entire application, even if only a specific component requires more resources.
  - Limited in terms of granular scalability.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
  - Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand. For example, a service handling user authentication can be scaled without affecting other services.
  - More flexible and efficient in terms of resource utilization.

### 4. **Development and Maintenance:**

- **Monolith Architecture:**

  - Easier to develop and test in the early stages, as all components are in one place.
  - However, as the application grows, the codebase can become large and unwieldy, making development, testing, and maintenance more challenging.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
  - Development can be more complex due to the need to manage multiple services, but each service is smaller and more manageable.
  - Easier to maintain and evolve individual services without affecting the entire system.

### 5. **Technology Stack:**

- **Monolith Architecture:**

  - Usually built with a single technology stack. This can be limiting if you want to adopt new technologies or frameworks.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
  - Each microservice can be built using different technologies, programming languages, or databases, depending on what best suits its specific needs.
  - Provides greater flexibility in choosing the right tools for each service.

### 6. **Fault Isolation:**

- **Monolith Architecture:**

  - If a failure occurs in one part of the application, it can potentially bring down the entire system.
  - Harder to isolate and handle faults.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
  - Failures are isolated to the specific service that encounters the issue. Other services can continue functioning, which enhances the overall resilience of the system.
  - Easier to implement fault tolerance and recovery strategies.

### 7. **Communication:**

- **Monolith Architecture:**

  - Communication between components is direct and in-memory, since everything runs within a single process.
  - No network latency, but the components are tightly coupled.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
  - Services communicate over a network using protocols like HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues.
  - Introduces network latency and complexity but allows for loose coupling and independent service operation.

### 8. **Organizational Impact:**

- **Monolith Architecture:**

  - Typically suited for smaller teams where close collaboration is required.
  - As the team grows, coordinating work in a monolithic codebase can become challenging.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
  - Enables larger teams to work independently on different services, fostering a more decentralized and agile development process.
  - Aligns well with DevOps practices and continuous delivery.

### Summary:

- **Monolith** is simpler to start with and may be suitable for smaller or less complex applications. However, it can become difficult to manage, scale, and evolve as the application grows.
- **Microservices** offer greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience, but they come with increased complexity in terms of development, deployment, and operations.

The choice between monolith and microservice architecture depends on factors such as the size and complexity of the application, team size, and the need for scalability and flexibility.

## Q4: Why do we need a useEffect Hook ?

The `useEffect` Hook in React is essential for handling side effects in functional components. Side effects are operations that occur outside the scope of rendering the UI, such as data fetching, subscriptions, timers, or manually modifying the DOM.

### Why We Need `useEffect`:

1. **Data Fetching**:

   - Often, components need to fetch data from an API when they mount. The `useEffect` Hook allows you to initiate data fetching after the component renders and update the state with the fetched data.

2. **Subscriptions and Event Listeners**:

   - If you need to subscribe to a data source (like WebSockets) or add event listeners (like `window` or `document` events), `useEffect` provides a way to set these up when the component mounts and clean them up when the component unmounts.

3. **Synchronizing with External Systems**:

   - Sometimes, you need to synchronize a component with an external system, like updating the document title, interacting with local storage, or working with third-party libraries. `useEffect` ensures these actions occur at the right time.

4. **Side Effect Cleanup**:
   - Side effects often require cleanup to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior. For example, you might need to unsubscribe from a data source or remove an event listener when the component unmounts. `useEffect` allows you to return a cleanup function that React will call during unmounting.

### How `useEffect` Works:

- **By Default**: `useEffect` runs after every render. This is useful for side effects that need to occur after the component has rendered to the screen.
- **Dependencies**: You can pass an array of dependencies as the second argument to `useEffect`. The effect will only run when one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful for optimizing performance and ensuring that the effect only runs when necessary.

- **Cleanup Function**: If your effect needs cleanup (like unsubscribing from a service or clearing a timer), `useEffect` allows you to return a cleanup function. This function runs before the component unmounts or before the effect runs again if the dependencies change.

### Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This will run after every render
    console.log(`Count is: ${count}`);

    // Cleanup (optional)
    return () => {
      console.log("Cleanup for count:", count);
    };
  }, [count]); // Effect only re-runs when 'count' changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- In this example, the `useEffect` hook logs the count value to the console every time it changes.
- The cleanup function runs before the next effect runs or when the component unmounts.

### Summary:

`useEffect` is a powerful tool in React for managing side effects in functional components. It enables you to perform operations like data fetching, subscribing to data sources, and updating the DOM in response to state or prop changes while ensuring that necessary cleanup occurs to prevent resource leaks and unwanted side effects.

## Q5: What is Optional Chaining ?

Optional chaining is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to safely access deeply nested properties of an object without having to explicitly check if each level of the object exists. If any part of the chain is `null` or `undefined`, the entire expression will return `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

### Syntax:

```javascript
let result = object?.property?.subProperty;
```

### How Optional Chaining Works:

- **Safe Property Access**: Instead of manually checking if each level exists, optional chaining (`?.`) allows you to access properties without worrying about `null` or `undefined` values.
- **Short-circuiting**: If any part of the chain is `null` or `undefined`, the entire expression immediately returns `undefined` and stops further evaluation.

### Example Usage:

1. **Accessing Nested Properties**:

   ```javascript
   const user = {
     name: "John",
     address: {
       street: "123 Main St",
       city: "New York",
     },
   };

   // Without optional chaining:
   const street = user && user.address && user.address.street; // '123 Main St'

   // With optional chaining:
   const street = user?.address?.street; // '123 Main St'
   ```

2. **Accessing Methods**:

   ```javascript
   const user = {
     name: "Alice",
     greet: () => "Hello!",
   };

   // Without optional chaining:
   const greeting = user.greet ? user.greet() : undefined; // 'Hello!'

   // With optional chaining:
   const greeting = user.greet?.(); // 'Hello!'
   ```

3. **Dealing with Arrays**:

   ```javascript
   const users = [
     { name: "John", age: 30 },
     { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
   ];

   // Accessing an array item safely:
   const firstUserName = users?.[0]?.name; // 'John'
   const nonExistentUser = users?.[5]?.name; // undefined
   ```

4. **Combining with Nullish Coalescing (`??`)**:

   - You can combine optional chaining with the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value if the result is `undefined`.

   ```javascript
   const user = null;

   const userName = user?.name ?? "Anonymous"; // 'Anonymous'
   ```

### Benefits:

- **Prevents Errors**: Avoids the common "cannot read property of `undefined`" or "cannot read property of `null`" errors when accessing nested properties.
- **Cleaner Code**: Reduces the need for multiple conditional checks, making your code more concise and easier to read.
- **Flexible**: Works with properties, methods, and even array elements.

### Use Cases:

- **Accessing deeply nested properties** in objects where some properties may not always be defined.
- **Calling functions or methods** on objects that might be `null` or `undefined`.
- **Safely accessing array elements** that may not exist.

### Summary:

Optional chaining is a convenient and safe way to access nested properties in JavaScript objects. It simplifies code and prevents runtime errors by returning `undefined` when an intermediate property is `null` or `undefined`. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures where some properties may not be guaranteed to exist.

## Q6: What is Shimmer UI ?

Shimmer UI refers to a visual effect used in user interfaces to indicate loading states, often seen in modern web and mobile applications. The shimmer effect creates a temporary placeholder that mimics the layout of the content that is being loaded. It gives users a sense of progress and improves the perceived performance of the application by showing that content is on its way.

### Key Characteristics of Shimmer UI:

1. **Loading Placeholder**:

   - Shimmer UI displays a skeleton or placeholder structure where content like text, images, or other elements will appear once they are loaded. These placeholders usually resemble the shape and size of the actual content.

2. **Animated Shimmer Effect**:

   - The defining feature is the animated gradient that moves across the placeholders, creating a "shimmering" or "waving" effect. This visual cue indicates that the content is being loaded.

3. **Improves Perceived Performance**:

   - Even if the content takes time to load, the shimmer effect can make the application feel faster and more responsive because users see an immediate visual response instead of a blank screen.

4. **Common in Skeleton Screens**:
   - Shimmer UI is often used as part of a skeleton screen, which is a type of loading screen that provides a basic layout of where content will appear. Skeleton screens with shimmer effects are now common in apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, and other content-heavy platforms.

### Example Use Cases:

- **Social Media Feeds**: When loading a list of posts, a shimmer effect is used to show where each post will appear, with placeholders for profile pictures, text, and images.
- **E-commerce Sites**: When browsing product lists, shimmer placeholders show where product images, titles, and prices will be displayed.
- **Content-heavy Websites**: Blogs, news sites, and other platforms that load large amounts of text and images might use shimmer UI to indicate content loading.

### Example Implementation:

In React, libraries like `react-content-loader` or custom CSS can be used to implement a shimmer effect. Here’s a simple example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ContentLoader from "react-content-loader";

const ShimmerPlaceholder = () => (
  <ContentLoader
    speed={2}
    width={400}
    height={160}
    viewBox="0 0 400 160"
    backgroundColor="#f3f3f3"
    foregroundColor="#ecebeb"
  >
    <rect x="0" y="0" rx="5" ry="5" width="400" height="160" />
  </ContentLoader>
);

export default ShimmerPlaceholder;
```

In this example, a rectangle is used to create a shimmer effect over a placeholder where content will be loaded.

### Benefits:

- **User Experience**: Enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback that content is being loaded.
- **Engagement**: Keeps users engaged during loading times, reducing the likelihood of frustration or abandonment.
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: Adds a modern and polished look to the application.

### Summary:

Shimmer UI is a technique used to indicate content loading in a visually appealing way. By showing animated placeholders that simulate the layout of the incoming content, it helps improve the user experience by providing immediate feedback and making the application feel faster and more responsive.

## Q7: What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement ?

In JavaScript, expressions and statements are fundamental concepts that serve different purposes in the language. Here's a breakdown of the differences between them:

### 1. **Definition:**

- **JavaScript Expression**:

  - An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value. Expressions can be as simple as a single value or as complex as operations combining multiple values, variables, or functions.
  - Examples include literals, variables, operators, function calls, and more.

- **JavaScript Statement**:
  - A statement is an instruction that performs an action. Statements typically do not return a value directly, but they control the flow of execution in a program, such as loops, conditionals, declarations, and assignments.

### 2. **Purpose:**

- **Expression**:

  - The primary purpose of an expression is to produce a value. Expressions are often used in situations where a value is expected, such as in assignments, function arguments, or conditional checks.

- **Statement**:
  - The primary purpose of a statement is to perform an action, like declaring a variable, executing a loop, or making a decision with an `if` statement.

### 3. **Examples:**

- **Expression**:

  ```javascript
  5 + 3; // An arithmetic expression that evaluates to 8
  "Hello, " + "World"; // A string expression that evaluates to "Hello, World"
  myFunction(); // A function call expression that returns the function's result
  x > 10; // A comparison expression that evaluates to true or false
  ```

- **Statement**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 5; // A variable declaration statement
  if (x > 10) {
    // An if statement that performs an action based on a condition
    console.log("x is greater than 10");
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // A loop statement that executes code multiple times
    console.log(i);
  }
  ```

### 4. **Return Value:**

- **Expression**:

  - Always resolves to a value, even if that value is `undefined`.
  - Example: `5 + 10` returns `15`.

- **Statement**:
  - Typically does not return a value. However, some statements like function declarations can return values when executed within expressions.
  - Example: An `if` statement does not return a value; it controls the flow based on the condition.

### 5. **Use in Code:**

- **Expression**:

  - Can be used anywhere a value is expected. Expressions can be part of statements.
  - Example: In the assignment `let x = 5 + 3;`, `5 + 3` is an expression that evaluates to `8`, which is then assigned to `x`.

- **Statement**:
  - Cannot be used as part of an expression. Statements often contain expressions.
  - Example: `if (x > 10) { console.log("x is greater than 10"); }` contains the expression `x > 10`, but the whole block is a statement.

### 6. **Complexity:**

- **Expression**:

  - Can range from simple values like `42` or `"hello"` to complex combinations involving operators, function calls, or other expressions.

- **Statement**:
  - Typically involves more complex structures like loops, conditionals, or blocks of code.

### Summary:

- **Expressions** in JavaScript are pieces of code that evaluate to a value and can be used in places where a value is expected.
- **Statements** are instructions that perform an action and control the flow of the program but do not necessarily produce a value.

Understanding the difference between expressions and statements is essential for writing clear and effective JavaScript code.

## Q8: What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example ?

Conditional rendering in React refers to the process of rendering different UI elements or components based on certain conditions. It allows you to dynamically choose what to display to the user depending on the state of your application.

### Example: Conditional Rendering in React

Let’s walk through an example where we conditionally render different content based on whether a user is logged in or not.

#### Scenario:

- If the user is logged in, display a welcome message.
- If the user is not logged in, display a login button.

### Code Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  // State to track if the user is logged in
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

  // Function to handle login
  const handleLogin = () => {
    setIsLoggedIn(true);
  };

  // Function to handle logout
  const handleLogout = () => {
    setIsLoggedIn(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Conditional Rendering */}
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome back, User!</h1>
          <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <h1>Please log in</h1>
          <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Management**:

   - The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `isLoggedIn` state, which determines whether the user is logged in or not. Initially, it's set to `false`, meaning the user is not logged in.

2. **Conditional Rendering**:

   - The `return` statement contains a conditional rendering block. This block uses the ternary operator (`? :`) to decide what to render:
     - If `isLoggedIn` is `true`, it renders a welcome message along with a "Logout" button.
     - If `isLoggedIn` is `false`, it renders a "Please log in" message with a "Login" button.

3. **Login and Logout Functions**:
   - The `handleLogin` function sets `isLoggedIn` to `true`, simulating a user login.
   - The `handleLogout` function sets `isLoggedIn` back to `false`, simulating a user logout.

### Different Ways to Implement Conditional Rendering:

1. **Using Ternary Operator**:

   - The example above uses the ternary operator for conditional rendering, which is concise and easy to understand for simple conditions.

2. **Using `&&` (Logical AND)**:

   - For conditions where you only want to render something if a condition is `true`:

   ```javascript
   {
     isLoggedIn && <h1>Welcome back, User!</h1>;
   }
   ```

3. **Using `if` Statements**:

   - You can use `if` statements inside the component to control what gets returned:

   ```javascript
   let content;
   if (isLoggedIn) {
     content = <h1>Welcome back, User!</h1>;
   } else {
     content = <h1>Please log in</h1>;
   }

   return <div>{content}</div>;
   ```

4. **Switch Statements**:
   - For multiple conditions, you might use a `switch` statement:
   ```javascript
   switch (userRole) {
     case "admin":
       return <AdminDashboard />;
     case "user":
       return <UserDashboard />;
     default:
       return <GuestView />;
   }
   ```

### Summary:

Conditional rendering is a powerful feature in React that allows you to display different UI components or elements based on the current state or props of your component. It enables dynamic user interfaces that can adapt to different scenarios, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Q9: What is CORS ?

CORS, or **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**, is a security feature implemented by web browsers to regulate how web applications interact with resources hosted on different domains (origins). It is a mechanism that allows or restricts web pages from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the original content.

### Understanding Origins:

- An **origin** is defined by the combination of a scheme (protocol), host (domain), and port.
  - Example of a single origin: `https://example.com:443`
  - Example of different origins:
    - `https://example.com` vs. `http://example.com` (different schemes)
    - `https://example.com` vs. `https://api.example.com` (different subdomains)
    - `https://example.com:443` vs. `https://example.com:8080` (different ports)

### Why CORS is Necessary:

- **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**:

  - Browsers enforce a security policy called the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts how resources (like JavaScript, iframes, or AJAX requests) can be fetched from different origins. By default, web pages can only request resources from the same origin (protocol, domain, and port).
  - This policy prevents potentially malicious scripts on one page from accessing sensitive data on another domain.

- **CORS as a Relaxation Mechanism**:
  - CORS allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources, thus relaxing the restrictions imposed by the Same-Origin Policy.

### How CORS Works:

When a web page makes a request to a different origin (e.g., using `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, or a form submission), the browser automatically includes an `Origin` header in the request, indicating the origin of the request.

- **Simple Requests**:

  - For "simple" requests (like GET or POST with specific content types), the browser sends the request directly, including the `Origin` header. The server responds with appropriate CORS headers:
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Specifies which origins are allowed (e.g., `*` for any origin, or a specific domain like `https://example.com`).
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Lists the HTTP methods allowed (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Lists which headers can be used (e.g., `Content-Type`).
  - If the response includes the correct headers, the browser allows the response to be accessed by the requesting web page.

- **Preflight Requests**:
  - For "complex" requests (e.g., those using methods like PUT, DELETE, or non-standard headers), the browser performs a "preflight" request before the actual request.
  - The preflight request is an `OPTIONS` request sent to the server to check if the actual request is safe to send. The server must respond with appropriate CORS headers.
  - If the server approves the request (by sending back the right headers), the actual request is sent.

### Example of a CORS Response:

Suppose a web page at `https://example.com` tries to fetch data from `https://api.anotherdomain.com`.

The browser sends this request:

```http
GET /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.anotherdomain.com
Origin: https://example.com
```

The server might respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST
Content-Type: application/json

{ "data": "some data" }
```

### Common Issues with CORS:

- **No CORS Headers**: If the server doesn’t include the correct CORS headers, the browser will block the response, and the web page will not be able to access it.
- **Mismatched Origin**: If the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header doesn’t match the origin of the requesting page, the browser will block the response.
- **Preflight Failures**: If the preflight request fails (e.g., the server doesn't respond with the necessary CORS headers), the actual request won't be sent.

### Summary:

CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers to control how web pages can request resources from different origins. It helps protect against certain types of attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), by allowing servers to specify who can access their resources. Proper configuration of CORS headers on the server is essential for enabling legitimate cross-origin requests while maintaining security.

## Q10: What is async and await ?

`async` and `await` are features in JavaScript that simplify working with asynchronous code. They provide a way to write asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain compared to using callbacks or promise chains.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **`async` Function**

An `async` function is a function that is declared with the `async` keyword. It automatically returns a promise, and the value returned from the function is wrapped in a promise.

- **Syntax**:

  ```javascript
  async function myFunction() {
    // code here
  }
  ```

- **Return Value**:

  - If the `async` function returns a value, it is automatically wrapped in a resolved promise.
  - If the `async` function throws an error, it is wrapped in a rejected promise.

- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  async function fetchData() {
    return "Hello, World!";
  }

  fetchData().then((result) => console.log(result)); // Logs: Hello, World!
  ```

#### 2. **`await` Expression**

The `await` keyword is used inside an `async` function to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved. It can only be used inside `async` functions.

- **Syntax**:

  ```javascript
  const result = await somePromise;
  ```

- **Behavior**:

  - `await` pauses the execution of the `async` function until the promise resolves or rejects.
  - If the promise resolves, `await` returns the resolved value.
  - If the promise rejects, `await` throws the error, which can be caught using `try` and `catch`.

- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  }

  fetchData().then((data) => console.log(data));
  ```

### Combining `async` and `await`

When you combine `async` and `await`, your code can handle asynchronous operations in a more synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.

- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  async function getUser() {
    try {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/user");
      const user = await response.json();
      return user;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    }
  }

  getUser().then((user) => console.log(user));
  ```

### Comparison with Promises and Callbacks

- **Callbacks**:

  - Using callbacks can lead to "callback hell" where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and manage.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data", function (error, response) {
      if (error) {
        console.error(error);
      } else {
        response.json(function (data) {
          console.log(data);
        });
      }
    });
    ```

- **Promises**:

  - Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations, but chaining multiple `.then()` calls can become unwieldy.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => console.log(data))
      .catch((error) => console.error(error));
    ```

- **`async` and `await`**:

  - `async` and `await` simplify the syntax and make asynchronous code look more like synchronous code, improving readability.
  - Example:

    ```javascript
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error);
      }
    }

    fetchData();
    ```

### Summary

- **`async`**: Declares a function as asynchronous and automatically returns a promise.
- **`await`**: Pauses the execution of an `async` function until a promise is resolved, allowing for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
- These features make handling asynchronous operations simpler and more intuitive compared to traditional callbacks and promise chains.

## Q11: What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in getRestaurants() ?

In the context of the `getRestaurants` function (or any function that deals with fetching data from an API), the line `const json = await data.json();` is used to parse the response from the API into a JavaScript object. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what this line does:

### Context of `getRestaurants`

Let's assume you have a function like this:

```javascript
async function getRestaurants() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/restaurants");
    const json = await response.json();
    return json;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching restaurants:", error);
  }
}
```

### Breakdown of `const json = await response.json();`

1. **Fetching Data**:

   - The `fetch` function is used to make a network request to the provided URL. It returns a promise that resolves to the `Response` object representing the response to the request.

2. **Response Object**:

   - The `response` object contains the raw data received from the server. This data is usually in a format such as JSON, text, or HTML.

3. **Parsing JSON**:

   - `response.json()` is a method of the `Response` object that reads the response stream and parses it as JSON. It also returns a promise that resolves to the parsed JSON data.

4. **`await` Keyword**:

   - The `await` keyword pauses the execution of the `async` function until the promise returned by `response.json()` is resolved.
   - This means that `json` will hold the result of the JSON parsing once the promise resolves.

5. **Storing the Parsed Data**:
   - `const json = await response.json();` assigns the parsed JavaScript object (or array) to the variable `json`.

### Summary of the Use:

- **Parsing the Response**: `await response.json()` is used to convert the raw response data into a JavaScript object that you can work with more easily in your application.
- **Handling JSON Data**: Most APIs return data in JSON format, so this step is crucial to converting that JSON data into a usable format in JavaScript.
- **Error Handling**: If the response cannot be parsed as JSON (e.g., if the response is not valid JSON), an error will be thrown, which you can catch and handle appropriately.

### Example:

Here’s a complete example demonstrating how this works:

```javascript
async function getRestaurants() {
  try {
    // Fetch data from the API
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/restaurants");

    // Parse the JSON response
    const json = await response.json();

    // Use the parsed JSON data
    console.log(json);
    return json;
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors
    console.error("Error fetching restaurants:", error);
  }
}

getRestaurants();
```

In this example:

- `fetch` retrieves the raw data from the API.
- `response.json()` parses the raw data into a JavaScript object.
- `await` ensures that the function waits for the parsing to complete before continuing, allowing you to work with the parsed data directly.
