## Q1: What is the difference between `Named export`, `Default export`, and `* as export`?

In JavaScript, especially when working with ES6 modules, you have different ways to export and import code. Here's a breakdown of the three types of exports you mentioned:

1. **Named Export**:

   - **Definition**: You can export multiple named values from a module. Each export must be imported using its exact name in the importing module.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```javascript
     // module.js
     export const foo = "foo";
     export function bar() {
       return "bar";
     }
     ```
     To import:
     ```javascript
     // anotherModule.js
     import { foo, bar } from "./module";
     ```

2. **Default Export**:

   - **Definition**: You can export a single default value or entity from a module. It can be any value (object, function, class, etc.) and does not need to be named. Default exports can be imported with any name in the importing module.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```javascript
     // module.js
     const foo = "foo";
     export default foo;
     ```
     To import:
     ```javascript
     // anotherModule.js
     import myFoo from "./module"; // 'myFoo' can be any name
     ```

3. **`* as` Export**:
   - **Definition**: This syntax allows you to import all named exports from a module as a single object. Each named export can then be accessed as a property of that object.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```javascript
     // module.js
     export const foo = "foo";
     export function bar() {
       return "bar";
     }
     ```
     To import:
     ```javascript
     // anotherModule.js
     import * as myModule from "./module";
     console.log(myModule.foo); // 'foo'
     console.log(myModule.bar()); // 'bar'
     ```

In summary:

- **Named Export** is used for exporting multiple values by name.
- **Default Export** is used for exporting a single value or entity as the default.
- **`* as` Export** imports all named exports as properties of a single object.

Each method is useful depending on how you want to structure and access your modules.

## Q2: What is the importance of `config.js` file.

The `config.js` file is commonly used in applications to manage configuration settings. Its importance comes from the following aspects:

1. **Centralized Configuration**:

   - It allows you to keep all configuration settings in one place. This makes it easier to manage and update settings without having to search through your entire codebase.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:

   - By separating configuration from the application logic, you ensure that changes in configuration do not directly affect the codebase. This promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.

3. **Environment Management**:

   - You can use different `config.js` files or configurations for different environments (development, testing, production). This helps in managing environment-specific settings like API endpoints, feature flags, and database connections.

4. **Ease of Deployment**:

   - When deploying your application, you can adjust the `config.js` settings to fit the deployment environment without changing the code itself. This is especially useful for changing configurations like URLs or keys.

5. **Security**:

   - Sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets can be managed in `config.js`. However, it's important to keep such sensitive information out of version control and use environment variables or secure storage mechanisms in production environments.

6. **Flexibility**:
   - `config.js` can be designed to export different configurations based on the environment or other conditions. This flexibility makes it easy to handle varying configurations in different contexts.

**Example Structure:**

```javascript
// config.js
const config = {
  development: {
    apiUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
    debug: true,
  },
  production: {
    apiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
    debug: false,
  },
};

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV || "development";
module.exports = config[environment];
```

In this example, the `config.js` file exports different settings based on the current environment, which can be accessed throughout your application.

Overall, `config.js` is a best practice for managing application settings in a modular and maintainable way.

## Q3: What are React Hooks ?

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 to simplify component logic and enable state management in functional components.

Here are the key React Hooks and their purposes:

1. **`useState`**:

   - **Purpose**: Manages state in functional components.
   - **Usage**:

     ```javascript
     import { useState } from "react";

     function Counter() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

2. **`useEffect`**:

   - **Purpose**: Handles side effects in functional components (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).
   - **Usage**:

     ```javascript
     import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

     function DataFetcher() {
       const [data, setData] = useState(null);

       useEffect(() => {
         fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
           .then((response) => response.json())
           .then((data) => setData(data));
       }, []); // Empty dependency array means it runs once when the component mounts

       return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : "Loading..."}</div>;
     }
     ```

3. **`useContext`**:

   - **Purpose**: Accesses context values within functional components.
   - **Usage**:

     ```javascript
     import { useContext } from "react";
     import { ThemeContext } from "./ThemeContext";

     function ThemedComponent() {
       const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

       return (
         <div style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.color }}>
           Hello, world!
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

4. **`useReducer`**:

   - **Purpose**: Manages complex state logic using a reducer function (similar to Redux).
   - **Usage**:

     ```javascript
     import { useReducer } from "react";

     const initialState = { count: 0 };

     function reducer(state, action) {
       switch (action.type) {
         case "increment":
           return { count: state.count + 1 };
         case "decrement":
           return { count: state.count - 1 };
         default:
           throw new Error();
       }
     }

     function Counter() {
       const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
           <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>
             Increment
           </button>
           <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>
             Decrement
           </button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

5. **`useRef`**:

   - **Purpose**: Accesses and interacts with DOM elements or persists values across renders without causing re-renders.
   - **Usage**:

     ```javascript
     import { useRef } from "react";

     function FocusInput() {
       const inputRef = useRef(null);

       const focusInput = () => {
         inputRef.current.focus();
       };

       return (
         <div>
           <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
           <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus the input</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

6. **`useMemo`** and **`useCallback`**:

   - **Purpose**: Optimize performance by memoizing values and functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
   - **Usage**:

     ```javascript
     import { useMemo, useCallback, useState } from "react";

     function ExpensiveComponent({ computeExpensiveValue }) {
       const memoizedValue = useMemo(
         () => computeExpensiveValue(),
         [computeExpensiveValue]
       );

       return <div>{memoizedValue}</div>;
     }

     function Example() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       const computeExpensiveValue = useCallback(() => {
         // Expensive computation here
         return count * 2;
       }, [count]);

       return (
         <div>
           <ExpensiveComponent computeExpensiveValue={computeExpensiveValue} />
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

React Hooks provide a more straightforward and modular approach to managing state and side effects compared to class-based components, enhancing code readability and reusability.

## Q4: Why do we need a useState Hook ?

The `useState` Hook is essential in React for managing state in functional components. Here’s why it’s important:

1. **State Management in Functional Components**:

   - Before React Hooks, only class components could manage state. With the `useState` Hook, you can add state to functional components, allowing you to use functional components more effectively and avoiding the need to convert them into class components.

2. **Simplifies Component Logic**:

   - Using `useState` allows you to encapsulate state logic within functional components, making them easier to read and manage. It reduces boilerplate code and complexity compared to class components, which require methods like `constructor`, `this.state`, and `this.setState`.

3. **Enables Local State**:

   - The `useState` Hook lets you create local state variables within a functional component. This state is specific to that component and is maintained across renders, making it easy to manage and update component-specific data.

4. **Improves Code Reusability**:

   - Functional components with `useState` can be more reusable and composable. Since you’re not bound to class-based lifecycle methods, you can create smaller, more focused components that can be combined to build complex UIs.

5. **Promotes Functional Programming**:

   - Hooks, including `useState`, encourage a functional programming style by avoiding classes and side effects that can make code harder to reason about. `useState` helps you manage state using functions and closures, which can lead to cleaner and more predictable code.

6. **Easy State Updates**:
   - `useState` provides a simple API for updating state. The `setState` function (returned by `useState`) allows you to update the state and trigger a re-render of the component. It also handles merging state updates, which simplifies state management.

**Example Usage**:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable named 'count', initialized to 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- `useState(0)` initializes the state variable `count` with a value of `0`.
- `setCount` is used to update the `count` value.
- Each time the button is clicked, `setCount` updates the state, causing the component to re-render and display the new `count`.

In summary, the `useState` Hook is crucial for managing state in functional components, providing a simple and effective way to handle state and keep your components clean and functional.
