## Q1: What is `JSX`?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of the components.

### Why JSX?

1. **Readable Syntax**: JSX looks a lot like HTML, which makes it easier to understand the structure of your components, especially for developers who are familiar with HTML and CSS.

2. **Seamless Integration with JavaScript**: JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions directly within your markup. You can dynamically display data or conditionally render elements using familiar JavaScript syntax.

3. **React Element Creation**: Under the hood, JSX is converted into JavaScript calls to `React.createElement`. For example, the JSX:

   ```jsx
   const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
   ```

   gets transformed into:

   ```javascript
   const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!");
   ```

   This means that JSX is not just a template language; it's a powerful syntax that allows you to use the full power of JavaScript in your UI creation.

4. **JSX Is Optional**: While JSX is popular in React development, it’s not mandatory. You can write your React components without it, but most developers prefer JSX because it simplifies the process of writing UI components.

### Key Features of JSX:

- **Embedding Expressions**: You can use JavaScript expressions inside curly braces `{}` in your JSX code. For example:

  ```jsx
  const name = "Raza";
  const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
  ```

- **Conditional Rendering**: You can conditionally render parts of the UI using JavaScript expressions, such as ternary operators.

  ```jsx
  const isLoggedIn = true;
  const element = <h1>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please sign in."}</h1>;
  ```

- **Styling and Attributes**: Attributes in JSX use camelCase instead of the usual HTML attribute names, and inline styles are written as objects.

  ```jsx
  const element = (
    <div className="myClass" style={{ color: "blue", fontSize: "18px" }}>
      Hello
    </div>
  );
  ```

JSX is a core part of React development that simplifies the process of creating dynamic and interactive UIs by combining HTML-like syntax with the power of JavaScript.

## Q2: Superpowers of JSX?

JSX has several "superpowers" that make it an indispensable tool in React development. These superpowers enhance the way developers write, structure, and manage UI components in their applications. Here are some of the key superpowers of JSX:

### 1. **Declarative Syntax**

- **Power**: JSX allows you to write components in a way that describes what the UI should look like, not how to create it. This makes the code more intuitive and easier to reason about.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  const greeting = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  ```
  This code declaratively defines an `h1` element with the text "Hello, World!".

### 2. **Combining UI and Logic**

- **Power**: JSX seamlessly integrates UI code with JavaScript logic. This means you can embed dynamic expressions directly within your markup, making your UI highly interactive and responsive to data changes.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  const name = "Raza";
  const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
  ```
  Here, the value of `name` is dynamically injected into the JSX, allowing for personalized UI elements.

### 3. **Component Composition**

- **Power**: JSX makes it easy to compose complex UIs from smaller, reusable components. Each component can have its own JSX structure, promoting modularity and reusability.
- **Example**:

  ```jsx
  function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
  }

  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Welcome name="Raza" />
        <Welcome name="Alex" />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  In this example, the `Welcome` component is reused with different data, showing how JSX encourages component reuse.

### 4. **Conditional Rendering**

- **Power**: JSX allows for conditional rendering using JavaScript expressions. This means you can display different UI elements based on the state of your application, all within a concise and readable syntax.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  const isLoggedIn = true;
  const element = (
    <div>{isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign in.</h1>}</div>
  );
  ```
  This code dynamically chooses which `h1` element to render based on the value of `isLoggedIn`.

### 5. **Efficient Updates**

- **Power**: JSX, combined with React’s Virtual DOM, makes UI updates efficient. When the state of a component changes, React uses the Virtual DOM to calculate the minimum number of changes needed to update the real DOM, leading to improved performance.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
    return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
  }
  ```
  The `Counter` component updates efficiently as the `count` state changes.

### 6. **Type Safety and Autocompletion**

- **Power**: When using JSX with TypeScript or modern JavaScript tooling, you gain type safety and autocompletion. This helps catch errors early and makes the development process smoother.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  function Welcome(props: { name: string }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
  }
  ```
  Type annotations help ensure that `name` is always a string, reducing bugs.

### 7. **Readability and Maintainability**

- **Power**: JSX code closely resembles HTML, making it more readable and easier to maintain, especially for developers familiar with web development.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  const nav = (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
  ```
  This code is clear and easy to understand, improving the maintainability of the application.

### 8. **Support for Fragmentation**

- **Power**: JSX supports React Fragments, allowing you to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM, keeping the DOM structure clean.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  function List() {
    return (
      <>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
  The `List` component returns multiple `li` elements without wrapping them in an unnecessary `div`.

These "superpowers" make JSX a versatile and powerful tool for building user interfaces in React, streamlining the development process, and enabling the creation of dynamic, efficient, and maintainable web applications.

## Q3: Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

The `type` attribute in the `<script>` tag specifies the scripting language of the code within the script.

### Role of the `type` Attribute:

1. **Specifying Script Language**: Historically, the `type` attribute was used to indicate the scripting language. For example, `type="text/javascript"` was commonly used to denote JavaScript. However, since JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML5, this attribute is no longer required for JavaScript, and the browser assumes the script is JavaScript if no `type` attribute is provided.

2. **Handling Non-JavaScript Languages**: The `type` attribute is necessary when using scripting languages other than JavaScript, such as TypeScript or other custom languages. The browser may need to handle these differently, or a preprocessor or library might process them.

3. **Modular and Custom Scripts**: In modern web development, the `type` attribute is used with `type="module"` to enable ECMAScript modules, allowing developers to use the `import` and `export` syntax directly in the browser.

4. **External Libraries or Custom Processing**: In some cases, the `type` attribute is used to indicate custom script types that a third-party library or framework processes. For example, you might see `type="text/template"` for templating engines, where the content isn't executed as a script but is instead processed by JavaScript.

### Options for the `type` Attribute:

1. **`text/javascript`** (or just `javascript`):

   - **Usage**: Specifies that the script is written in JavaScript. This is the most common type and is the default, so it's generally not necessary to specify.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <script type="text/javascript">
       console.log("This is JavaScript");
     </script>
     ```

2. **`module`**:

   - **Usage**: Specifies that the script is an ECMAScript module. Modules allow you to use `import` and `export` statements to manage dependencies and split your code into reusable pieces.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <script type="module">
       import { myFunction } from "./myModule.js";
       myFunction();
     </script>
     ```

3. **`text/babel`**:

   - **Usage**: Used with the Babel transpiler to write JSX or modern JavaScript that needs to be transpiled into standard JavaScript.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <script type="text/babel">
       const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
       ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root"));
     </script>
     ```

4. **`text/typescript`**:

   - **Usage**: Used when writing TypeScript directly in the browser (often in development or educational environments). The TypeScript code must be transpiled to JavaScript before execution.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <script type="text/typescript">
       let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
       console.log(message);
     </script>
     ```

5. **`text/template`**:

   - **Usage**: Used with templating engines or frameworks where the script content is a template rather than executable code. The content is usually processed by a JavaScript function.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <script type="text/template" id="my-template">
       <div>{{message}}</div>
     </script>
     ```

6. **`application/json`**:

   - **Usage**: Used to include JSON data within a script tag, typically when embedding JSON data that JavaScript can later parse and use.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <script type="application/json" id="data">
       { "name": "Raza", "age": 25 }
     </script>
     ```

7. **`application/ld+json`**:
   - **Usage**: Used for embedding structured data in JSON-LD format, often for SEO purposes, to provide metadata about the web page.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <script type="application/ld+json">
       {
         "@context": "https://schema.org",
         "@type": "Person",
         "name": "Raza",
         "jobTitle": "Front-End Developer"
       }
     </script>
     ```

### Modern Use:

- **Omitting `type`**: For JavaScript, it’s now standard practice to omit the `type` attribute since browsers assume `text/javascript` by default.
- **`module`**: The use of `type="module"` has become more common with the adoption of ES modules in modern JavaScript development.

The `type` attribute, while not always necessary for basic JavaScript, remains a valuable tool for specifying the context in which scripts should be interpreted or processed, particularly in complex or modern web applications.

## Q4: {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX

In JSX, the three different ways of using components—`{TitleComponent}`, `{<TitleComponent />}`, and `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`—have distinct meanings and uses. Here's a breakdown of each:

### 1. **`{TitleComponent}`**

- **Meaning**: This refers to the component itself, not its rendered output. You're passing the `TitleComponent` function or class as a reference, rather than invoking or rendering it.
- **Usage**: You typically use this when you want to pass a component as a prop or store it in a variable, but not render it immediately.
- **Example**:

  ```jsx
  function Wrapper({ Component }) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Wrapper Component</h1>
        {<Component />}
      </div>
    );
  }

  // Passing TitleComponent as a prop
  <Wrapper Component={TitleComponent} />;
  ```

  Here, `TitleComponent` is passed as a prop, and it's rendered later inside the `Wrapper` component.

### 2. **`{<TitleComponent />}`**

- **Meaning**: This syntax creates and renders an instance of the `TitleComponent` as a self-closing tag. It's used when the component has no children or content between its opening and closing tags.
- **Usage**: This is the most common way to render a component in JSX when you don't need to nest other elements or text inside it.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <TitleComponent />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
  This will render the `TitleComponent` inside the `div`.

### 3. **`{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`**

- **Meaning**: This is the standard way to render a component with an explicit opening and closing tag. It allows you to pass children (other components, elements, or text) between the tags.
- **Usage**: Use this syntax when you need to include child elements or content within the `TitleComponent`.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <TitleComponent>
          <p>This is a child paragraph</p>
        </TitleComponent>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
  This will render the `TitleComponent` with a `p` element as its child.

### When to Use Each:

- **`{TitleComponent}`**: Use this when you need a reference to the component itself, such as when passing it as a prop.
- **`{<TitleComponent />}`**: Use this for rendering a component without any children or when the component is self-contained.
- **`{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`**: Use this when the component needs to contain other elements or when it's more readable or consistent with your code style.

### Summary:

- **`{TitleComponent}`** is a reference to the component.
- **`{<TitleComponent />}`** renders the component as a self-closing element.
- **`{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`** renders the component with the possibility of containing children or other nested content.
